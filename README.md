# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classification 🩺📊
**MSc Data Management & Analytics | University of Cape Coast**

## 🎯 Project Overview
As an incoming Data Scientist, my goal is to transform raw clinical data into actionable decision-support tools. This project utilizes the 
**Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to build a high-accuracy classifier using the **CART (Decision Tree)** algorithm.

## 🚀 Features
- **Predictive Engine:** A Decision Tree model built with `tidymodels` and `rpart`.
- **High Performance:** 94.6% Balanced Accuracy and 95.5% Sensitivity.
- **Interactive App:** A live **Shiny Dashboard** for real-time diagnostic simulation.
- **Clinical Insight:** Focus on reducing False Negatives for patient safety.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** R
- **Key Libraries:** `dplyr`, `tidymodels`, `rpart.plot`, `shiny`, `caret`
- **Methodology:** Stratified 80/20 split, Gini Impurity splitting.

## 📊 Results Summary
- **Balanced Accuracy:** 94.63%
- **Sensitivity (Recall):** 95.51%
- **Specificity:** 93.75%
